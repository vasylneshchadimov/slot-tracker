# Game Lounge / Slot Tracker JavaScript interview

JavaScript interview challenges

## What to do

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

2. Implement missing parts in the files inside `/challenges` folder that are marked with `// write your code here` comment.

3. To test your code run `npm run test`. For the development you can use `npm run test:watch` which watches for changes and runs tests automatically. To run tests for the single file only, you can use `npm run test ./test/<file_name>` and `npm run test:watch ./test/<file_name>`

4. Once everything is ready, push your code to a new Github repository and send us a link to review it.

## Notes

- There is no time limit.
- Keep it simple. There's no need to do more than what's asked in the challenge description.
- The tests are there to help you to validate your solutions. You don't need to pass them all in order to submit your answers.
- You can install any additional packages to help you.
- Leave comments in your code where it will help us understand your code.
- If you have any additional information for us before we evaluate your code, freel to pass a note to us along with your repository link.
